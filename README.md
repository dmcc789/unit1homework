# Code Refractor

Deirdre Cruice Unit 01 Homework: Code Refractor

For Unit 01 Homework I worked a ticket request to refractor the code of an existing marketing company's website.     

The goals of refractoring this website are to ensure that the site meets accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.  Meeting accessibility standards is important for companies that want to maximize access to their website, as well as avoid litigation.  Search engine optimization is necessary for a company to connect with their target market online. 

To accomplish the goals I first reviewed and revised the provided code to ensure it met accessibility standards.  I included "alt" attributes for all image tags.  Next, to optimize the site for search engines, I reviewed the HTML element structure and replaced any applicable <div> elements with their corresponding semantic HTML elements.  This included header, nav, main, section, aside, and footer.  Additionally I ensured the website's <title> element was descriptive and appropriate.  

Lastly upon review of my changes, I realized some of the CSS styling had been broken by my structural HTML changes.  I reviewed and revised the CSS to ensure it was up to date with my HTML element changes.  Upon further review of the CSS I realized it could be consolidated and reorganized to be cleaner and simpler.  I combined selectors and declarations into singular rules where I found duplication.  Additionally I reorganized by moving a section of styling up in the file to match the HTML layout.  

I am interested in any feedback on my work and any areas of the code that could have been improved beyond what I did.
